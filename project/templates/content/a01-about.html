<p>I’m a Full Stack Software Engineer who loves building software. I recently developed a Flask and React web app where you can play a trivia game and manage questions among some categories. I’d love to combine my passion for learning and teaching with my software development skills to continue building new businesses with other devs, designers, and salespeople.<p>
