<p>I am a Full Stack Software Engineer with experience in Python, Flask, and DevOps. I am excited to combine my skills in software development with my love of teaching and learning to create new digital businesses. I recently developed a Flask API backend with a React frontend where you can play a trivia game and manage questions among some categories.<p>
