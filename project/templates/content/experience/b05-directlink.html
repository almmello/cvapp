<p>I successfully deployed the DirectLink system in 7 cities with an average population of 300,000 and built 150 points of presence on a radio network of 400 servers, supporting 2K subscribers.</p>
<p>I created a design pattern to reuse my JAVA + JSP + MySQL code and build web applications faster. After this, I used Excel VBA to generate those classes, which reduced development time by 85%.</p>
